# HOW TO SET UP BOT ON YOUR SERVER


1) Sign into discord and go to https://discord.com/developers/applications/
2) Create a new application, name it anything.
3) Click create a bot
4) COPY AND PASTE CLIENT ID UNDER THE GENERAL INFORMATION SECTION! YOU WILL NEED THIS TO ADD THE BOT TO YOUR SERVER 
4) COPY AND PASTE THE TOKEN ID FROM THE BOT SECTION! YOU WILL NEED TO PASTE THIS INTO MY SOURCE CODE
5) INVITE THE BOT TO THIS LINK https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=ID_HERE&scope=bot&permissions=0 ( CLIENT ID GOES INTO "ID_HERE")
6) INSIDE MY SOURCE CODE CHANGE THE BOT TOKEN TO THE TOKEN YOU COPIED FROM BOT SECTION


# PLANS MOVING FORWARD
- Implement proxies
- Connect bot to a Ec2 Instance so that it can run without me having to manually have the script running
- Add more websites to monitor
