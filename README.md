1) Sign into discord and go to https://discord.com/developers/applications/
2) Create a new application, name it anything.
3) Click create a bot
4) COPY AND PASTE CLIENT ID UNDER THE GENERAL INFORMATION SECTION! YOU WILL NEED THIS TO ADD THE BOT TO YOUR SERVER 
4) COPY AND PASTE THE TOKEN ID FROM THE BOT SECTION! YOU WILL NEED TO PASTE THIS INTO MY SOURCE CODE
5) INVITE THE BOT TO THIS LINK https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=ID_HERE&scope=bot&permissions=0 ( CLIENT ID GOES INTO "ID_HERE")
6) INSIDE MY SOURCE CODE CHANGE THE BOT TOKEN TO THE TOKEN YOU COPIED FROM BOT SECTION


# PLANS MOVING FORWARD
